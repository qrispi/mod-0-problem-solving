// For each challenge you complete, include comments showing the **overall goal** in your own words, your **pseudocode**, and your **final solution**. 
// Start with an array of strings. Print only the words that include the letter combination "ing".

// The directions pretty much sum it up, I could maybe make it clearer by saying print each word from the array that includes "ing" and no other words from the array.

// 1. Create an array that includes some strings with ing and some without
// 2. Find a suitable method for matching a pattern in a string - most likely .includes()
// 3. Run a for loop that checks each value in the array and prints only the ones that have ing
